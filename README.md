# Yarn Count Converter

A departmental project by Arnob Mahmud.<br>
In textiles, yarn count is a number that represents the diameter or fineness of a yarn, either in terms of weight by length or length by weight. The direct system measures the weight of a consistent length of yarn, with a higher yarn count indicating a heavier and coarser yarn.
